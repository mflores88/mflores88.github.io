title: My First Month As An Intern
---

I'm finally almost free from school (47 subjects gone, one more to go). Reflecting on those four long years I sometimes can't believe how long and rough the road was up to this point. So how did I end up being an intern at Nearsoft? We'll backtrack a bit to answer that question.

In 2008 I was studying a Computers Systems Engineering degree at Instituto Tecnol√≥gico Superior de Cananea. Initially I became disatisfied with the point of view engineering took on most subjects. I wanted to know how thing were done. Yet I longed for more, I wanted to know why things were done in that way. After researching career options, I settled on Computer Science as my next try. 

I moved to Hermosillo, Sonora four years ago, in 2010. I had elected Computer Science because I thought I would learn more advanced programming techniques and methodologies. I really was a bit naive. Surprise! Computer Science was not what I was rooting for. As it turns out, Computer Science is more closely related to mathematics. It is a scientific degree, focusing on the science behind computers. Of course we have subjects that cover topics on programming, but they are not the main focus of the career. Computer Science, for the most part, has a theoretical aproach to computers.

Initially, I considered dropping out and continuing off where I left in Computer Systems Engineering, but as it turns out, some of my best choices have been made by accident. I discovered that even though I'm not a math genius, I could understand what professors taught in class (this doesn't mean that I didn't strive to keep up). 

I had really good luck on finding friends who I could (and still can) depend on. Each one of us have strengths that compliment our weaknessess, and we put that to our advantage. We quickly found out that we constituted a good working team and took assignments together. Through the years we developed several tools for different subjects. The most recent of them is a system designed to resolve Multi Route Vehicle Problems using Google Maps. It is the most interesting problem in which I've worked and is continuosly updated by us.

After four years, I was in a position of having to much time in my hands and I had to take a quick decision. Either take a one hour class (the only one left) in the morning and relax, or take that class and find something to do. I took the decision that made more sense, at least to me. As an almost graduate I had to take steps to start building my professional career. 

One of the things most graduates are not prepared for is expertise. You go to school for an average of four years and try to accomplish every assigned task, yet you are not prepared for work. Job vacants almost always require that candidates have an amount of experience. As anybody in this position, I was full of questions, the most important being, how do I get that experience? It's understandable, coming fresh out of college and experiencing the job trade for real is a daunting experience. You can quickly get caught up in trying to cover all bases while doing nothing really well. 

Some companies aliviate this problem by taking interns. In an internship program, people have a period of time where they can gain experience on a certain subject, while in the process becoming a candidate to work in said company. And thats what I aimed for.

A couple of companies here in Hermosillo actually offer internship programs. After thinking a bit about it, the obvious answer was Nearsoft. I had actually been in touch with the company a year before. I participated in the first Students of Excellence program they organized in 2013. It was a great experience for me and my first peek at how things get done in the IT industry. So, I took my shot.

I'm not revealing every step involved in the recruitment process (you'll have to apply for it and see for yourself), but one thing I can say is that it's not that far from a recruiting process for a job position. It is a whole experience in its own right, and one I fully recommend to every fellow student I know. It's got a great balance between technical knowledge and social skills evalutation. 

I officially had my first day as an intern on Septemper 1st, and looking back, I can really see what I've accomplished. I know have a sense of what I'm missing in order to compete for a job position. I have a greater sense of the skills that I will need to develop as an IT professional. And finally I've started to develop the necessary social skills involved in team working (I really needed these ones because I'm a bit shy).

So, sitting here at my desk, how do I feel about being an intern here at Nearsoft? I feel great, and I'm happier than I've been in a long time. That is the feeling of fitting in and doing what you really love. So, do I recommend it? Absolutely, give it a shot. The benefits are huge, you'll get a taste of IT jobs and of course acquire the expertise that every employer requires, but almost no graduates have, to apply for a job.
