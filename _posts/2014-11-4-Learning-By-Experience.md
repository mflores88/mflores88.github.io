Nice work, you've finally completed a career related to IT. I suspect you must be really proud, and looking at those years you can remember how hard you worked on your school projects and assesments. But actually, what did you learn? You might say, "Well I can code in X language." Great! Really? Are you a super programmer? That's what I thought. You are just a coder.

Now don't be too hard on yourself. There's nothing wrong on only being a coder. Actually, your halfway through the road to becoming a programming master. It's still a long road from here and you'll require perseverance, humbleness, and of course, enthusiasm. If you take to heart these three requirements, the long road of Mastery of Programming will be a straight lane with no detours.

Of course you might ask, what about mathematical and logical thinking? Well, if you are a coder (and I trust you are because we've made it to this point), you already have those skill. I trust that you worked hard in your college years and you have had the time to sharpen you skills (and excersie your fingers for some heavy coding.)

Now on to the three skills that I mentioned above, I'll explain each and one of them with excruciating detail (not really). You just hang there buddy (please do).

Perseverance deals with going forward even if it means backtracking a little. Technology changes at a vertiginous pace, what's in today, is out tomorrow. No, really. Research a little. Maybe a certain technology you use now and swear by it isn't that popular now. So what do you have to do to keep pace with technology? Here's where perseverance comes into the picture. Actually, it's really simple. You just have to keep researching and studying your whole life. It's a harsh truth, I know, and even if it might become tedious or hard at times, in the end it really pays off.

Even if you know a lot about technology, making mistakes is something you'll have to deal with everyday. This is where humbleness comes into play. Being humble, accepting constructive criticism, and improving on every mistake is a strength, not a weakness. Whenever you make a mistake and someone gives you positive feeback, the best you can do is take it and improve your skills.

Everybody has a bad day once in a while. Sometimes things don't workout the way we intended, but don't ever let despair get a hold of you. Everything you do, everything you create, must be done with enthusiasm. When you spend your time doing the things you love, you do them well. Keep up that enthusiasm in learning what you like, creating things that inspire. Don't let your enthusiasm go down.

These are just some tips that I've personally used while being an intern, but they can apply universally. Give them a try, embrace them and feel the benefits.
